      <p>Purpose - This editorial aims to introduce a special issue of Library Hi Tech on "Virtual research environments: issues and opportunities for librarians". It defines the concept of the virtual research environment (VRE), describes its relationship both to the virtual learning environment and to Web 2.0, and proposes that librarians play a central role in VRE development and use. Findings - The VRE is likely to have a huge impact on many aspects of research and, thus, on the role of the academic and the research librarian. If VREs are to fulfill their potential as useful and usable artifacts, librarians need to have a central role in their development and application. Practical implications - Librarians need to be proactive in identifying and advocating for their potential roles in VRE development and use. These roles need to be taken into account in the curricula of schools of library and information studies. Originality/value - This is an ideal time for librarians to explore the potential of VREs because there is still time to influence their eventual form.</p>

      <h2 class="article-header">Librarians and VREs</h2>
      <p class="main-text">The virtual research environment, or VRE, is a relatively young concept and is still making the transition from research topic to real-world product. It has begun to appear on the radar of a small but increasing number of librarians and, to a lesser extent, researchers. The VRE is likely to have a huge impact on many aspects of research and, thus, on the role of the academic and the research librarian. If VREs are to fulfil their potential as useful and usable artefacts, librarians need to have a central role in their development and application. Whether librarians are facilitated to make this contribute depends, in part, on whether they are proactive in identifying and advocating for their potential roles.</p>
	
      <h2 class="article-header">Defining the VRE</h2>
      <p class="main-text">What exactly is a VRE? An early definition is still widely quoted:
A set of online tools and other network resources and technologies interoperating with each other to support or enhance the processes of a wide range of research practitioners within and across disciplinary and institutional boundaries[1].<p>
      
      <p class="main-text">As Voss and Procter (<a href="#ref3">2009</a>) emphasise in this special issue: The aim of a VRE is to provide an integrated environment that supports the work of a community of collaborating researchers. That is, a VRE brings together previously separate tools needed for conducting the research and for collaboration, support for which is increasingly recognised as an integral aspect of researchers' work rather than something that can be added on as an afterthought.</p>
      
      <p class="main-text">As Dunn (<a href="#ref1">2009</a>) comments, the term Virtual Research Environment has yet to permeate the "mainstream academic community". But, although the VRE as an entity is relatively novel, the concepts that it incorporates are far from new. Various other related technologies, such as collaborative (or virtual) research communities, Web 2.0 tools and e-research tools may constitute VREs or may be potential components of a VRE. To this end, Dunn describes Google Earth as a useful illustration of "what a VRE is not". On the basis that Google Earth is an online environment with potential applications, it can be a very useful component of a VRE - but it is not a VRE per se because there is no mechanism for managing or authenticating users, the user does not have ultimate control over the data, and there is no focus on a particular question or topic. </p>
	
      <h2 class="article-header">"Those who do not know history..."</h2> <!--As this is a quote, I've used sentence case here-->
      <p class="main-text">Virtual Learning Environments (VLEs) are now widely used in higher education and are frequently interoperable with the e-information environment provided by university libraries. Whereas VLEs concentrate on the provision of teaching and learning functionality, VREs emphasise the provision of analysis and research tools. However, there is some overlap of functionality between VLEs and VREs, in particular in the provision of administrative and management features. Several of the papers in this collection refer to VREs' roots in VLEs. In particular, Masson reviews the impact of VLEs and asks what lessons can be learned for VREs.</p>
<p class="main-text">The common origin and complementary nature of VREs and VLEs can hide some fundamental differences between the two concepts. The JISC VRE programme has highlighted one of the major differences: while there is considerable commonality between VLEs, VREs can differ widely in their requirements depending on the discipline they support; thus VREs require the development of considerably more bespoke technology. However, it is yet to be demonstrated whether this is a permanent situation or just a side effect of VREs being at an early in their development lifecycle. Different disciplines may have different proprieties: a given feature may be low priority for one discipline and high priority for another, but ultimately useful for both.</p>
	
      <h2 class="article-header">Web 2.0</h2>
      <p class="main-text">Web 2.0, or the Social Web, is revolutionising the way we interact with information and with one another online by "harnessing [the] collective intelligence" of Web users (O'Reilly, <a href="#ref2">2005</a>), thus facilitating community, dynamic collaboration and the sharing of ideas. The momentum of academic research could benefit enormously from adopting Social Web ingenuity and functionality. This is increasingly being recognised by the research community in a swathe of new projects, for example, the national UK centres for both e-Science and E-Social Science have recently initiated projects evaluating the impact and relevance of Web 2.0 for researchers and e-Research infrastructure. Another example is the Science Foundation Ireland OJAX++ project, which aims to investigate and illustrate how concepts from the Social Web can be applied to the research environment via the creation of a Web 2.0-based VRE[2] . Similarly, the JISC-funded MyExperiment project describes itself as developing a "Web 2.0 VRE"[3].</p>            
	
      <h2 class="article-header">From Theory to Practice</h2>
      <p class="main-text">In 2007, over half of UK researchers interviewed had never heard of VREs; a further 31 per cent had heard of VREs but knew little about them. This is mirrored by a small Irish study that found that few researchers had heard of the term VRE and most were unfamiliar with the concept.</p>
      
      <p class="main-text">However, academics are becoming familiar with social networking tools, as evinced by an increase in their use from 3 or 4 per cent in 2006 to 25 per cent in 2008. Collaboration tools are an important component of VREs; the academic's increasing familiarity with social networking technology will be helpful in encouraging uptake of VREs. It does not matter whether researchers identify the integrated environment of tools they are using as a VRE, so long as it is assisting them in their research.</p>
      
      <p class="main-text">Librarians, on the other hand, need to be able to recognise a VRE when they see one because they should be drivers of the technology. And it is clear that librarians are increasingly identifying the VRE as an important concept that they need to investigate. Now is the ideal time for librarians to explore the potential of VREs because, at this stage of their development, there is still time to influence their eventual form.</p>
